# ❤️ Support This Project

This integration is developed and maintained **entirely in my free time, alongside a regular full-time job**. Every feature, every bug fix, and every documentation update happens in the evenings and on weekends.

> **If this integration saves you time or makes your smart home better, please consider supporting its continued development!**

## 💡 Why Your Support Matters

| Why it helps | Details |
| :----------- | :------ |
| 🕒 **Time** | Development happens exclusively in free time. More support = more time available for this project. |
| 🔧 **Hardware** | Testing requires real devices — test phones, spare Home Assistant hardware, etc. These cost real money. |
| 💪 **Independence** | The more support I receive, the less I depend on other income sources and the more I can invest in open-source projects like this one. |
| 🚀 **Features** | Donations directly motivate new features, faster bug fixes, and better documentation. |
